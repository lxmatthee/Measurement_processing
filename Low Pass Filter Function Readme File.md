# Measurement_processing
Functions for processing electrical grid measurements

This script implements a low pass filter function that filters out high-frequency components of a signal. The script uses the Butterworth filter, which is a common type of low pass filter, to filter a mixed signal composed of two signals with different frequencies.

Functions
The script has two main functions:

butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order=5): This function generates the Butterworth filter coefficients based on the cutoff frequency and order specified by the user.
butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order=5): This function applies the filter to the input signal using the coefficients generated by the butter_lowpass function.
In addition, the script has two additional helper functions:

create_signal(signal_properties, plot=False): This function generates a mixed signal composed of two signals with different frequencies and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame. If the plot parameter is set to True, it also plots the signals.
filter(data, n, order, fs, cut_off): This function takes the input signal, signal length in data points, filter order, signal sample rate, and filter cutoff frequency as input parameters and returns the filtered signal as a list.
Inputs
The filter function takes the following inputs:

data: the input signal to be filtered.
n: signal length in data points.
order: the order of the filter.
fs: the signal sample rate.
cut_off: the filter cutoff frequency.
Outputs
The filter function returns a list containing the filtered signal.

Usage
To use the script, run the script using Python 3 and the following libraries installed: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and pandas. Then, call the filter function with the input parameters as described above.

In the example provided in the script, a mixed signal composed of two signals with frequencies of 50 Hz and 1000 Hz is generated using the create_signal function. The filter function is then used to filter the mixed signal using a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz and a filter order of 5. Finally, the original mixed signal and the filtered signal are plotted using the matplotlib library.
